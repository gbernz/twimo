## Instructions on how to download

Since the 5280 team are not full-time developers, the app is forever in pre-release and as such is not code signed. This essentially means further steps are needed when downloading the app to play with it!

- Once you have downloaded the application, launch the application.
- You will receive a notice saying ‚Äútwimo‚Äù cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. TwiMo is a passion project from Twilio Solutions Engineers, and as such, is not code signed. More on that below

## Disclaimer

TwiMo was developed by adventurous Twilions in an effort to provide customers with a means to play with Twilio APIs, whether they are a developer or not. Since this project was stemmed from a Q4 2022 internal hackathon (üéâ and GLOBAL winner!! ü•≥), TwiMo comes as is and is not a managed product or actively being worked on. Twilio is a Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS), and as such provides tools & building blocks to build out your application's communications functionality. There may be UI content displayed within this application that is not available through Twilio's APIs.

For any questions or help with building, check out our [docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs) and [talk to our sales team!](https://www.twilio.com/help/sales)
