## Downloading & Installing

Since the 5280 team are not full-time developers, the app is forever in pre-release and as such is not code signed. This essentially means further steps are needed when downloading the app to play with it!

### Downloading:

#### For Mac:
- Instructions on how to download on Mac:
- Click [here](https://github.com/gbernz/twimo/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha/twimo-1.0.0-alpha.dmg) to download TwiMo to your computer
- Once you have downloaded the application, launch the application.
- You will receive a notice saying ‚Äútwimo‚Äù cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. TwiMo is a passion project from Twilio Solutions Engineers, and as such, is not code signed. More on that below
- If you are on a Mac, you will want to select Cancel, and navigate to your system preferences
- Once at your system preferences, go to Security & Privacy
- Here, you will see a notice "twimo" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.
- Next to this, you will see a button Open Anyway, select this button
- You will then receive a notice saying "macOS cannot verify the developer of ‚Äútwimo‚Äù. Are you sure you want to open it?"
- Select Open and TwiMo will launch on your computer

#### For Linux:
You can find more info [here](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html)!

### Installing:
After downloading TwiMo you will have to allow your computer to open the application as it is not currently code signed. Code signing is used to assure users that the app is from a known source and was not tempered with but it can be a lengthy process and was determined to not be necessary for this SE Hackathon. We are planning to explore getting TwiMo code signed in the future but for now please follow the below steps to download the app onto your computer.
 
Mac Users:
1. Download TwiMo and place in your applications folder
2. Navigate to your Security & Privacy settings and click on the lock icon in the lower left corner to allow for changes
3. You will see ‚ÄúTwiMo App was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.‚Äù Click on the ‚ÄúOpen Anyway‚Äù button.
4. You can now use TwiMo as you would any other app!
 
Window Users:
1. Download TwiMo and open the app
2. The Windows SmartScreen pop-up will open saying it prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Click the ‚ÄúRun Anyway‚Äù button (if it is not visible click more info first)
3. You can now use TwiMo as you would any other app!

## Disclaimer

TwiMo was developed by adventurous Twilions in an effort to provide customers with a means to play with Twilio APIs, whether they are a developer or not. Since this project was stemmed from a Q4 2022 internal hackathon (üéâ and GLOBAL winner!! ü•≥), TwiMo comes as is and is not a managed product or actively being worked on. Twilio is a Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS), and as such provides tools & building blocks to build out your application's communications functionality. There may be UI content displayed within this application that is not available through Twilio's APIs.
